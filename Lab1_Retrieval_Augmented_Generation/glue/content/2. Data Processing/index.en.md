#### Section Overview

One of the key features of AWS Lake formation is its ability to secure access to data in your data lake. Lake Formation provides its own permissions model that augments the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions model.

This exercise covers basic data access permission setting for the data-analysts using Lake Formation. 

This is a critical step in defining fine grained access to the Data Catalog tables, columns and rows in your data lake.
